            <p>Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets,</p> <p>including Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.[10] Muslims consider the Quran in Arabic to be the unaltered and final revelation of God.</p> <p>Like other Abrahamic religions, Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded in paradise and the unrighteous punished in hell.</p> <p>Religious practices include the Five Pillars of Islam, which are obligatory acts of worship, as well as following Islamic law (sharia),<p/> <p>which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society, from banking and welfare to women and the environment.</p> <p>The cities of Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam.</p></div>
